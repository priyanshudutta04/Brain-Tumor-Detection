## About

Globally, over 700,000 people are diagnosed with a brain tumor each year. Early detection is crucial as it significantly improves treatment outcomes and survival rates. Timely intervention helps in managing symptoms and reducing the tumor's impact on the brain.

This brain-tumor-classification model, powered by a convolutional neural network (CNN), tries to accurately differentiate between tumor and non-tumor images using brain MRI images. By analyzing these medical images with high precision, it aids in early detection and timely medical intervention, enhancing patient outcomes.

## Data

The datataset used is the kaggle's `Brain MRI` dataset, which consists of mri images of brain with and without tumor.
